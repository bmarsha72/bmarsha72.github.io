My very first awesome website.  I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing.

This is February 20, 2016, and I'm a Noob.  But I'm hoping to master this in 12 weeks.

I just figured out how to preview the Markdown format in Atom.  Very cool.

I'm going to play around with some formatting stuff now.  Maybe some [links to Google](http://google.com).  Or some **bold** stuff.  <h1>Headers?</h1>  I don't know.  *Italics*, maybe.

Here's a list of my favorite Ferraris:

1. 250 P
2. 250 Europa
3. 166 Inter
4. 308 GT4

And a photo of a Ferrari 166 Inter:

and here's a code snippet:

```
var hardConcept = function(){
    console.log("help me with this!")
  }```
