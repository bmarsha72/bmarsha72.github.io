My very first awesome website.  I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing.

This is February 20, 2016, and I'm a Noob.  But I hope to make progress rapidly.

I just figured out how to preview the Markdown format in Atom.  Very cool.

I'm going to play around with some formatting stuff now.  Maybe some links.  Or some bold stuff.  Headers?  I don't know.  Italics, maybe.
