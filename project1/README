<h1>HELL TOUPEE

  <i>Stakeholder - Brian Marshall

<h2>Welcome to Hell Toup√©e, the Trump Lib
game.

The object is to select speech components from the pull-down
lists provided, then press the button to hear the mad-lib of
Donald Trump speaking the mad lib.


This is an audio API using callback functions
to play sequential MP3 audio snippets of
Donald Trump that exist in the public domain.

Technologies used:

+html
+jQuery
+Javascript
+ClipGrab
+WavePad

The biggest difficulty encountered was finding
a way to play the selected MP3's in the correct
order, independent of order selected,
and triggering the final audio event to play
uninterrupted.

No animals were harmed in the construction of this API.
